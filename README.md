# MSP430_Design

Hello, my name is Zachary Bonneau. I am a Texas Tech University Computer Engineering Undergrad with a particular interest in the field of 
microprocessor/digital system design via HDls (icarus verilog in this instance). This repository contains a small project of mine. To learn 
more about RISC processor design, I have tasked myself with recreating to the best of my ability the MSP430FR6989 microprocessor using 
icarus verilog. This repository serves as the permanent resting place of this labor, in what will most likely remain its unfinished state.
